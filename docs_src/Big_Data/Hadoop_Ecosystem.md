# Hadoop Ecosystem

Hadoop is not a single product, but rather a software family. Its common components consist of the following:
 
- Pig, a scripting language used to quickly write MapReduce code to handle unstructured sources 
- Hive, used to facilitate structure for the data 
- HCatalog, used to provide inter-operatability between these internal systems 
- HBase, which is essentially a database built on top of Hadoop 
- HDFS, the actual file system for hadoop.
- Apache Mahout
- Packaging for Hadoop: [BigTop]( http://bigtop.apache.org/ )

Hadoop structures data using Hive, but can handle unstructured data easily using Pig.
