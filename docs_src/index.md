You will find here a collection of cheatsheets, code templates and snippets that I have collected over the years...

Given that they were created for my own use, these notes are often very terse and dense. Thank you for your patience, while I am slowly improving their readability. I also have hundreds more to move to GitHub Pages :-) 

In the meanwhile, feel free to use as you wish. Please email me suggestions and corrections.
